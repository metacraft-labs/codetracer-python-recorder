# Questions from 2025-09-17

- Q: For ISSUE-012, when we say "all variables accessible at the
  step", should we capture module-level globals via `frame.f_globals`
  on every line, or limit ourselves to the executing frame's locals?
  If globals are in scope, do we restrict them to files under the
  traced program's root to avoid enormous dumps?
  
  A: It's good to avoid large dumps. Let's only record those globals
  which are actually accessed or modified in the given scope. So at
  each step in a given scope we track if a new global was accessed,
  and if so we track it until the end of the scope. We need to
  describe how to implement this in practice in a separate issue.

- Q: Do we have a product requirement for filtering internal names
  when capturing variable state for ISSUE-012? The pure-Python tracer
  currently skips double-underscore names and function objectsâ€”should
  both recorders follow that rule, or do we need an explicit
  allow/deny policy (e.g., keep `__name__`, drop modules)?
  
  A: Let's not filter internal names initially. We might later change
  after we see what the first implementation looks like. It's good to
  prepare good example scripts in the `/examples` folder which will
  allow me to see what a typical trace will look like when we don't
  filter anything.

- Q: Before the dedicated value-encoder work lands, how much sampling
  should we apply to large containers while implementing ISSUE-012? Do
  we need hard caps on length/depth today, and if so what limits keep
  the UI usable until the encoder revamp?

  A: Just use the `encode_value` function as is and don't change it
  unless we have missing functionality which causes our recorder to
  crash. We'll work on this later.
