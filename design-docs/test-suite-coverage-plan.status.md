# Test Suite Coverage Plan Status

## Current Status
- ✅ Plan doc expanded with prerequisites, detailed Just targets, CI strategy, and an implementation checklist (see `design-docs/test-suite-coverage-plan.md`).
- ✅ Implementation: coverage dependencies added to the dev shell (`flake.nix`) and UV groups (`pyproject.toml`).
- ✅ Implementation: `just coverage-*` helpers landed with matching documentation in `codetracer-python-recorder/tests/README.md`.
- ✅ Implementation: CI now runs `just coverage` on Python 3.12 with non-blocking jobs, uploads JSON/XML/LCOV artefacts, and posts a PR comment summarising Rust/Python coverage (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- ✅ Assessment: capture baseline coverage numbers before proposing enforcement thresholds.
