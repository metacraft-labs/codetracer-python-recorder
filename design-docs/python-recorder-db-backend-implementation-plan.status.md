# Python Recorder DB Backend Integration – Status

## Part 1 – `codetracer-python-recorder`
- ✅ CLI redesigned: accepts trace directory, format, activation path, and diff preference, recording the latter in metadata for the main Codetracer binary to act on.
- ✅ Trace artefacts (`trace.json`, `trace_metadata.json`, `trace_paths.json`) verified via end-to-end CLI execution; metadata now captures recorder details.
- ✅ Wheel packaging now installs a `codetracer-python-recorder` console script that shells out to `python -m codetracer_python_recorder`.
- ✅ New unit and integration tests cover argument parsing plus `python -m` execution to guard against regressions.
- ✅ README documents the CLI, flag semantics (including the fact that diff processing happens in the Codetracer CLI), and packaging expectations for installers.

## Next Steps
- Coordinate with Part 2 owners to hook the new CLI into the db-backend flow inside the main Codetracer codebase.
- Extend CI/pipeline tasks to distribute the wheel artefacts across desktop bundles once the upstream integration lands.
