Create an initial test suite for codetracer-python-recorder.

Following TDD we want to start by writing tests.

The test suite should follow the specification at design-docs/test-design-001.md
The tests should be written in the `/tests` subdirectory and it should be possible to run them using our current approach of `just venv dev test`.

If the module turns out to be missing functions or types required for the test, add them but with empty bodies. (for Python functions raise `NotImplemented` exception in the body of the function)
If a test can be written both in Python and in Rust prefer writing it in Python.
If a code modification needs to be done in the module and it is possible to do it both in Python and in Rust, prefer writing it in Python.

If there is any item in the test suite which doesn't contain enough
