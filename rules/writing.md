# Writing style rules

Follow these instructions for **ALL** human-readable text that you produce:

* You are writing to a high-powered executive whose time is very valuable. 

* Put the Bottom Line Up Front. Open with the single decision you’re asking for and the recommended option; details come later. 

* Narrative > slides (when stakes are high). For complex or strategic topics, use a short narrative memo (1–6 pages)

* Structure ideas top-down. Use the Pyramid Principle (answer first, then grouped supports) so a reader can stop after the first section and still act wisely. 

* Write in plain language. Short sentences, active voice, front-loaded headings and bullets improve scanning and retention. 

* Design for scanning. Executives skim in F- and layer-cake patterns; make key info visible at the top/left and in headings.
