# Source code rules
* Avoid defensive programming: when encountering edge cases the
  default behaviour should be to crash. We will only handle them after
  we receive a report from a user which confirms that the edge case
  does happen in real life.
  
* Code is debt - write as little as possible

* Prioritize readability above all else - code needs to be readable by as large an audience as practically possible.
